## movie-search-next
This is a movie search application created using Next.js framework and React.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Please note
This app enables searching after the user enters at least three valid strings in the search input.
Also, the OMDB api does not return any movie lists for common searches like 'the'.
